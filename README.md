# 0010-Lab6
The program takes in a person's name and their favorite fast food location, and then helps them realize that their favorite fast food location is wrong. Specifically, the program prompts the user for their name and favorite fast food location, then prints a string that tells them that their choice of fast food location is wrong.



To install, simply copy the 0010-Lab6 repository through github onto your personal workspace, and then run the section of code labeled: Lab6Code.ipynb . Upon running the code the user will be prompted to input their name in the form of a string, and afterwards input the name of a fast food restaurant in the form of a string as well, following which a string will be printed with that information.


For any editors wishing to contribute to this project, simply make a fork and enter in a pull request to the depository when finished. The program as it is right now is quite basic, only taking in two user input variables to create a basic string. The project could be expanded in any number of ways through adding additional variables, taking in information from additional sources, and outputting more than a simple string message.
